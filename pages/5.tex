\section*{Matrix Manifesto}

We believe:

\begin{itemize}
    \item People should have \textbf{full control} over their own communication.
    \item People should \textbf{not be locked} into centralised communication silos,
          but instead be free to pick who they choose to host their communication, without limiting
          who they can reach.
    \item The ability to \textbf{converse securely and privately} is a basic human right.
    \item Communication should be available to everyone as a \textbf{free and open}, unencumbered, standard and global network.
\end{itemize}
